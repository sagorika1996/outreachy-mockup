User contribution summary tool - Microtask3 <br><br>
Rewarding community members for smaller contributions could lead to significant aggregate contribution to a project. The tool should 
serve as symbols of acknowledgement and to monitor their impact on the community. 

This is a simple design mockup for the summary tool. I'll briefly go over the basic functionalities:

1. The design consists of three views: Overview, Starred articles view, Complete contribution list view.
2. Overview consists of the following:
  - User details: Such as display pic, username, full name, location, workplace etc.
  - Top X percentile in Y category: Shows that the user is among the top contributors in the mentioned categories.
  - Badges: The whole point of creating a contribution summary tool is to motivate editors to participate on 
  Wikimedia projects. Badges could be used as a reward for contributions that may not necessarily be extraordinarily 
  significant from a Wikimedia projectâ€™s point of view but may still be meaningful to an individual. We can have badges like:
    - Contributed to X+ featured articles.
    - Contributed to X+ good articles.
    - X+ page view on an article created by the user.
    - X+ edit count.
    - Created X+ articles.
    - Best new article in a given category:
    - Admin.    
  - Pinned articles: User can showcase the articles that best represent their work. Using the they can pin any article they 
  contributed to. If the user doesn't customize his/her pinned articles, we'll continue to show their best articles. 
  - Contribution calender: The contributions calendar shows user's contribution activity. Actions such as the following 
  can be considered as contribution:
    - Editig an article
    - Creating a new article
    - Renaming and page deletion
    - Adding images, sounds and videos
    - Adding lists, tables and templates
  - Recent contributions: It will show the few most recent contributions made by the user.
3. Starred articles: Starring an article allows the user to keep track of articles that they find interesting, even if they 
aren't associated with it. 
4. Complete contribution list: Shows the complete list of contributions made by the user ordered by timestamp.

The ideas are similar to the already existing contribution summary tools like [Github](https://github.com/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 
There are many unknowns which can be discussed over and finalised later. Further a timeline of events can also be added to showcase in detail every important event in a chronological manner.
