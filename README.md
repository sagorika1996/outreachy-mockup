# Contribution Summary Tool Mockup

## Description
Rewarding community members for smaller contributions could lead to significant aggregate contribution to a project. The tool should 
serve as symbols of acknowledgement and to monitor their impact on the community. 

Important points to keep in mind while designing the tool's interface:
1. This tool is aimed to be utilized in professional environments.
2. Summarize the data in a manner which is understandable for someone not familiar with Wikipedia contributions.

This is a simple design mockup for the summary tool. I'll briefly go over the basic functionalities that can be included in the tool:
1. Profile Overview Section:
- User details: Such as display pic, username, full name, location, workplace etc.
- Top X percentile in Y category: Shows that the user is among the top contributors in the mentioned categories.
- Badges: The whole point of creating a contribution summary tool is to motivate editors to participate on 
  Wikimedia projects. Badges could be used as a reward for contributions that may not necessarily be extraordinarily 
  significant from a Wikimedia projectâ€™s point of view but may still be meaningful to an individual. We can have badges like:
  - Contributed to X+ featured articles.
  - Contributed to X+ good articles.
  - X+ page view on an article created by the user.
  - X+ edit count.
  - Created X+ articles.
  - Best new article in a given category.
  - Admin.

2. Pinned articles: User can showcase the articles that best represent their work. Using the they can pin any article they 
  contributed to. If the user doesn't customize his/her pinned articles, we'll continue to show their best articles.

3. Recent contributions: It will show the few most recent contributions made by the user.

4. Contribution calender: The contributions calendar shows user's contribution activity. Actions such as the following can be considered as contribution:
- Editing an article
- Creating a new article
- Renaming and page deletion
- Adding images, sounds and videos
- Adding lists, tables and templates

5. Starred articles: Starring an article allows the user to keep track of articles that they find interesting, even if they 
aren't associated with it. This view shows all the articles starred by the user.

6. Complete contribution list: Shows the complete list of contributions made by the user ordered by timestamp.

7. A timeline of events can also be added to showcase in detail every important event in a chronological manner.

8. Adding filter options on contribution list: This will provide the user with the ability to filter out contributions made in only in a particulart domain, between particular dated, on particular types of articles.

## Mockup
The ideas are similar to the already existing contribution summary tools like [Github](https://github.com/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
